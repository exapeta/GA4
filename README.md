GOOGLE ANALYTICS 4

Here is an example of the events section of our GA4 property. This sample data shows events such as downloads (for resources like eBooks & brochures), as well as form submissions (to track user interest). These events can then be used to inform what areas of our websites are effective, and what clients are interested in.

This also ties into Google Ads.
